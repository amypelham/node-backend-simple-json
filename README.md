# Node Backend simple Json
This coding challenge was to take a simple server.js file and clean it up to be more concise and easier to read.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, VS Code, Node.js


## Optimizations

The CSS and HTML files could use some love. I purposefully kept them simple in order to focus on the JavaScript side of things. If I redid this I'd add more form to my function.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great opportunity to play with switch case statements.
